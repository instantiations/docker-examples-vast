This file contains instructions and tips for configuring the various web servers
and placement of WebConn files when using the VA Smalltalk WebConn Web Server Interface. 

==================================================================================

General Configuration

Setting the ABTWSI_BASENAME environment variable on your web server machine allows you
to define the default filename convention used by the WSI components for configuration
and log files.  If this variable is not set, the default naming convention is to use 
filenames starting with the executable name when using CGI, or abtwsi when using the
server API libraries.  The default directory used, if ABTWSI_BASENAME is not defined, 
is the current web server working directory.    

For example, if you start the CGI program, abtwsac, from the d:\cgi-bin directory,
and the ABTWSI_BASENAME environment variable is not set, the default name used for all
configuration and log files will begin with 'd:\cgi-bin\abtwsac' (for example, 
d:\cgi-bin\abtwsac.cnf).  If, instead, the ABTWSI_BASENAME environment variable is set
to 'e:\mystuff\test' before executing abtwsac, the configuration and log file names
used will begin with e:\mystuff\test (for example, e:\mystuff\test.cnf).

The best way to set the ABTWSI_BASENAME environment variable for each platform is, 
as follows.  For Windows and OS/2 a SET statement, such as 
'SET ABTWSI_BASENAME=d:\WsiDir\abtwsi' is used.  For Win/95, this statement should be
added to your autoexec.bat file.  For Win/NT, the statement should be added as a 
System environment variable, from the System Properties object on the Control Panel.
For OS/2, the statement should be added to your config.sys file.  For unix platforms
an export statement is used, such as 'export ABTWSI_BASENAME=/WsiDir/abtwsi'.

When running any of the WSI interfaces, you will also need to ensure that the common
WSI shared libraries, such as abtwsc and abtwstt, can be found by your operating
system.  For Win/95, the location of these files should be added to the PATH statement
in your autoexec.bat file.  For Win/NT, this information should be added to the PATH 
System Environment variable, from the System Properties object on the Control Panel.
For OS/2, this information should be added to the PATH statement in your config.sys
file.  For unix platforms, a reference to these files can be added to a commonly 
searched library path such as /usr/lib or a libpath environment variable can be set 
by using an export statement.  For AIX, the environment variable to set is LIBPATH, 
for Sun/Solaris it is LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and for HP/UX it is SHLIB_PATH.


Configuration Files

Two files needed for all installations are the WSI configuration file and the
WSI message format file.  The default name for the configuration file is abtwsi.cnf
and the default name for the message format file is abtwsi.htm.  The filenames for
these files can be overridden by setting the ABTWSI_BASENAME environment variable, 
as noted above.


Error Logging

For the CGI program, abtwsac, and the Microsoft ISAPI shared library, abtwsam, 
errors are logged to WSI log file.  The default name for this file is abtwsi.log 
and can be overridden by setting the ABTWSI_BASENAME environment variable, as 
noted above.

For the Netscape NSAPI, abtwsan, and IBM ICAPI, abtwsai, shared libraries, errors
are logged using the web server error log services, only.

==================================================================================

CGI Server Configuration

For CGI, there is no specific server configuration needed beyond that needed
for any other CGI program.  The CGI executable, abtwsac, should be placed
in a directory that you have defined on your server for executable CGI programs
and the configuration and message format files, *.cnf and *.htm, should be placed 
in the directory described by the ABTWSI_BASENAME environment variable, if defined,
otherwise place them in the working directory of the CGI program when it is 
executed.  For the latter case, this is usually the directory where you placed
the CGI executable, but not always.  You also need to ensure that the WSI shared
libraries, abtwsc and abtwstt, can be found by your operating system (see 
above). 

To access your WebConn part via CGI, your URL would look something like:

  http://myServerName/cgi-bin/abtwsac.exe/MyPartName

==================================================================================

IBM Internet Connection Server ICAPI Configuration

To use the ICAPI shared library interface, you will need to add the following lines
to your httpd.cnf (or httpd.conf) file.  These lines need to be inserted before any 
other service directive.  A good place to add these is right before the AddType 
directives for the default Mime types.

  ServerInit d:\cgi-bin\abtwsai.dll:AbtWsiServerInit
  ServerTerm d:\cgi-bin\abtwsai.dll:AbtWsiServerTerm
  Service    /abtwsi* d:\cgi-bin\abtwsai.dll:AbtWsiService*

The drive and directory, d:\cgi-bin, should be the directory you copied the WSI 
executable components to; use the correct name of the ICAPI shared library for 
your operating system.  The Service directive path, /abtwsi/*, can be any path 
descriptor that you want your end users to use to invoke your WebConn part.
You also need to ensure that both the WSI shared library file and the common library 
files, abtwsc and abtwstt, can be found by your operating system (see above).  The 
configuration and message format files, *.cnf and *.htm, should be placed in the 
directory described by the ABTWSI_BASENAME environment variable, if defined, 
otherwise place them in the working directory of the web server.   

To access your WebConn part via ICAPI, your URL would look something like:

  http://myServerName/abtwsi/MyPartName

==================================================================================

NetScape Server NSAPI Configuration

To use the NSAPI shared library, you will need to add the following lines to 
your obj.conf file. 

Before any other Init directive, add the following lines:

  Init fn="init-cgi"
  Init funcs="AbtWsiServerInit,AbtWsiService,AbtWsiSetPathInfo" fn="load-modules" shlib="d:/cgi-bin/abtwsan.dll"
  Init fn="AbtWsiServerInit"

Before the default Object directive, add the following lines:

  <Object name="abtwsi">
  ObjectType fn="force-type" type="text/html"
  Service fn="AbtWsiService"
  </Object>

In the default Object directive, after the line <Object name="default"> add  
the following lines:

  NameTrans fn="AbtWsiSetPathInfo" separator="/abtwsi/"
  NameTrans from="/abtwsi/*" fn="assign-name" name="abtwsi"

In the above examples, the drive and directory, d:/cgi-bin, should be directory you
copied the WSI executable components to; use the correct name of the NSAPI shared 
library for your operating system.  The path in the NameTrans directives, /abtwsi/, 
can be any path descriptor that you want your end users to use to invoke your 
WebConn part.  The string used in the first entry must be the same as the one used 
in the second, but without the trailing '*'.  You also need to ensure that the NSAPI 
shared library and the common libraries, abtwsc, abtwstt, and abtwstn, can be found by
your operating system (see above).  The configuration and message format files, *.cnf
and *.htm, should be placed in the directory described by the ABTWSI_BASENAME 
environment variable, if defined, otherwise place them in the runtime working 
directory of the web server.  For CGI, you can also change the first Init line to 
the following, to set the environment dynamically for each CGI invocation:

  Init fn="init-cgi" ABTWSI_BASENAME=d:/cgi-bin/abtwsi

This technique can also be used for setting any other environment variables you need 
at runtime.  For example, if you're running under AIX and LIBPATH is not being passed 
through to the CGI program by the server, you can set LIBPATH dynamically so that 
abtwsac can find it's shared object files (abtwsc.a, abtwstt.so):

  Init fn="init-cgi" ABTWSI_BASENAME=d:/cgi-bin/abtwsi LIBPATH=/usr/mylibs:/otherlibs

To access your WebConn part via NSAPI, your URL would look something like:

  http://myServerName/abtwsi/MyPartName

NOTE:  See Configuration Tips below, for more information on using NSAPI on
       HP-UX and AIX.

==================================================================================

Microsoft Internet Information Server ISAPI Configuration

To use the ISAPI shared library no specific server configuration is needed beyond
that needed for any CGI executable program.  The ISAPI shared library, abtwsam, 
should be placed in a directory that you have defined on your server for executable 
CGI programs and the configuration and message format files, *.cnf and *.htm, 
should be placed in the directory described by the ABTWSI_BASENAME environment 
variable, if defined, otherwise place them in the same directory you placed the 
ISAPI shared library.  You also need to ensure that the ISAPI shared library, and 
the common shared libraries, abtwsc and abtwstt, can be found by your operating system
(see above). 

To access your WebConn part via ISAPI, your URL would look something like:

  http://myServerName/cgi-bin/abtwsam.dll/MyPartName

==================================================================================

Configuration Tips 

  1) Unable to resolve hostname

     If you receive errors complaining that WSI was unable to resolve a hostname
     in your WSI configuration file or unable to resolve the local host name, 
     use a dotted-decimal form for the hostnames used on your Transport keywords
     in your WSI configuration file.

  2) Using the NSAPI interface under HP-UX

     There are potential problems using the standard TCP/IP calls in a multi-threaded
     Netscape environment on HP-UX.  This is because Netscape uses an internal
     pseudo-threaded mode on this platform, instead of native threading.  What may 
     happen is that all other psuedo-threads running may be blocked during a TCP/IP
     call such as a socket read.  To help overcome this, we have supplied an 
     additional transport shared library for HP, abtwstn.sl, that uses the Netscape 
     TCP/IP calls that are supposed to be safe in a psuedo-threaded environment.  You 
     should use this shared library in place of the standard abtwstt.sl file.  If
     you still experience blocking problems, it is recommended that you re-configure
     your Netscape server to be in 1 NSAPI thread per process mode instead of the 
     default x NSAPI threads per process mode, for this platform.

  3) Using the NSAPI interface under AIX

     As with HP-UX, Netscape servers running AIX use a pseudo-threaded mode instead 
     of native threading which may cause blocking in certain situations.  Read the 
     previous problem description for HP-UX for more information.  Unfortunately, the
     Netscape TCP/IP calls appear to fail on AIX so a replacement transport shared
     library is not shipped for AIX.  If you experience blocking problems when running, 
     NSAPI programs on AIX, it is recommended that you re-configure your Netscape 
     server to be in 1 NSAPI thread per process mode instead of the default x 
     NSAPI threads per process mode.

  4) Modifying the WSI Error Message Format

     You can modify the format of the WSI error messages to suit your application 
     by modifying the content of the WSI error format file, abtwsi.htm.  The 
     contents of this file can be any valid HTML tags.   The specific error description
     and any additional Verbose information is inserted where the tag 

        #_Insert_Error_Message_Here_#

     is encountered in the text.  You can even leave the error description out
     of the message returned to your user by leaving this tag out of your WSI errror
     format file.  The error will still be logged if error logging is enabled.  

  5) Reloading the WSI configuration file

     When running the CGI interface the WSI configuration file is loaded for
     each invocation.  When running the native server APIs, the WSI configuration
     file is loaded on time at server initialization.  To reload the configuration
     file, you must restart your web server.
