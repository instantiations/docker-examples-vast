## Example

This example is a [Seaside] (https://github.com/SeasideSt/Seaside) web application that simulates a Traffic Light. It's a very simple example but enough to show several features. Note that the `.icx` image size is only 3.5MB and it allows stack dumping, remote debugging, etc etc.

The web application is running under port `7777` and so you get to it from a web browser in a similar way to this:

http://yourpihostname.local:7777/trafficlight


## Different Docker images examples

As you can see, there are multiple docker files. We would like to experiment with different OSs, flavors and sizes. We also want to experiment with other 3er party images as our base image. If you get another example working, let us know!

## Tested environments

This example was run Raspberry Pi 3 B+ with Raspbian as the host OS.

## Using regular Linux/x86/x64

You may want to run this example on a regular Linux and architecture. If you are interested on this, let us know and we can provide it.
