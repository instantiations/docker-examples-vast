; Linux .INI for VA Smalltalk 9.1ARM
;

;IMPORTANT NOTES:  
; 1) The information in this file is read ONCE when the image is started.
;    Specific entries may be re-read at a later time when an application
;    is loaded or an IC is bound to the running image.
;    If you want to change a value, you must exit VA Smalltalk and then
;    start VA Smalltalk to pickup the changes.
;
; 2) Some information in this file is used only at development time;
;    other information is used at both development time and at runtime.
;    Furthermore, some stanzas are optional at runtime -- these stanzas
;    are identified with comments describing their optionality.

; installationPath: This is the directory into which CTL files using the
;                   pre-V5.5 style of feature loading should be placed.
;                   Unlike the installationPath of V5.0, this	is a single
;                   directory, NOT a semicolon-delimited list of directories.

[EmLibraryInterface]
; DefaultName: This is the full path (including the filename itself) of the
;              manager library. The path must be one reachable by the manager
;              server's file system.
; ServerAddress: This is the host name (or dotted address) of the server
;                machine that provides access to the manager library.
;                Leave this blank for FileI/O.

[Help]
; By default, the system-defined browser and newsreader will be used by the
; help subsystem.  However, you can override the default by specifying the
; browser and/or newsreader you want to use here.  For example:

;browser=firefox
;newsreader=mozilla-thunderbird


; HelpRootDirectory is the location of the help mapping files
HelpRootDirectory=help/

; HelpDocs is the location of the help documents themselves.  It can be
; either a local file reference URL or a website URL.  
; Default is the Instantiations website help URL.
;HelpDocs=file:///help/
HelpDocs=http://www.instantiations.com/docs/91/

[VM Options]
; Set the NewSpace size to 2MB.  Comment out the line to use the default of 256KB.
newSpaceSize=2097152

; Set the initial OldSpace size to what you believe is the steady-state object memory
; requirements of your application.  Since this parameter is application dependent, a
; suggested value of 20MB is provided, but it is commented out so that the actual image
; size is used.
;oldSpaceSize=20971520

; Set the memory allocation increment to a small divisor (less than 10) of your
; steady-state OldSpace size.  Since this parameter is application dependent, a
; suggested value of 4MB is provided, but it is commented out so that the default
; increment of 2MB is used.
;allocationIncrement=4194304

; Set the minimum size of free object memory after a garbage collection.  The larger
; this value is, the less frequently garbage collection will be required (at the
; trade-off of some "wasted" memory).  Since this parameter is application dependent,
; a suggested value of 2MB (1/2 the memory allocation increment) is provided, but it
; is commented out so that the default free size of 500KB is used.

[PlatformLibrary Name Mappings]
; Almost all .SO files referenced by VA Smalltalk have aliases (logical names) that are mapped here.
; Note that some aliases are mapped to blank values which indicates that the function is either linked
; into the VM itself on this platform or not available on this platform.

; Both the keywords (logical names) and values (.SO names) are case sensitive.
