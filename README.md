This project serves as a public place where VA Smalltalk users can see and submit Docker examples. Ideally we would like to have many examples showing different operating systems, CPU architectures, alternatives and customizations.

## Quick Start

- Install `Docker` in the machine you want to run the containers
- Clone this repository
- Pick of the provided examples.
- Run the Docker `build` and `run` commands that can be found in each `Dockerfile`
- Read blog posts:
  - [Getting started with Docker and Smalltalk!](https://dev.to/martinezpeck/getting-started-with-docker-and-smalltalk-4po1)
  - [Step 2: Single-node Docker Swarm and Smalltalk](https://dev.to/martinezpeck/step-2-single-node-docker-swarm-and-smalltalk-46i0)

## Experiments already run

- Use `docker-compose` and allow having N number of replicas (our VAST images) running in the same node with a load balancer on front.
- Use `Docker Swarm` to create our own cloud and run N number of VAST images distributes in M number of nodes.
- Run Docker in ARM 32 bits (Raspberry Pi 3B+ and Raspbian) and ARM 64 bits (Raspberry Pi 3B+ / Rock64 with Ubuntu Server / Armbian).
- Take a look to [portainer.io](https://www.portainer.io/) container for graphical management.
- [Experiment with Alpine Linux](https://github.com/vasmalltalk/docker-examples/blob/master/source/SeasideTrafficLights/Raspberry/experiments/alpine-raspbian_Dockerfile). Results were not as good as expected because Alpine uses `musl` instead of `glibc`. If you install `glibc` then the docker image gets much bigger and quite similar to a `debian slim`. In addition, it's `glibc` does not seem to work correctly on ARM.

## Next steps

There are lots of areas of interest we would like to investigate and research. But a few possibilities are:

- Make VA run with more different operating systems:
  - A regular CentOS/RedHat/Fedora variant.
  - Fedora Atomic
- Try with [balenaOS](https://www.balena.io/os/) as a host OS and a [pigpio-ready image](https://github.com/lachatak/rpi-pigpio).
- Test our [VAST GPIO binding](http://vastgoodies.com/projects/Raspberry%2520Pi%2520Hardware%2520Interface) from within a container.
- Even if not exactly related to Docker, we would also like to adapt current examples for Kubernetes and OpenShift.
