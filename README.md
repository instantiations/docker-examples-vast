This project serves as a public place where VA Smalltalk users can see and submit Docker examples. Ideally we would like to have many examples showing different OS alternatives and customizations.

## Quick Start

- Install `Docker` in the machine you want to run the containers
- Clone this repository
- Pick of the provided examples.
- Run Docker `build` and `run` commands


## Next steps

There are lots of areas of interest we would like to investigate and research. But a few possibilities are:

- Make VA run with docker more images:
  - A regular CentOS/RedHat/Fedora variant.
  - Alipe Linux and Fedora Atomic
- Try with [balenaOS](https://www.balena.io/os/) as a host OS and a [pigpio-ready image](https://github.com/lachatak/rpi-pigpio). This way we can also test the [VAST GPIO binding](http://vastgoodies.com/projects/Raspberry%2520Pi%2520Hardware%2520Interface)
- Take a look to [portainer.io](https://www.portainer.io/) container for graphical management.
- Use `docker-compose` and allow having N number of replicas (our VAST running images) running in the same node with a load balancer on front.
- Experiment with `Docker Swarm` and `Kubernetes`
